## **MNIST classifier with Neural Networks**


### Overview

This project implements a **handwritten digit recognition system** using the MNIST dataset and a **Neural Network** built with **TensorFlow/Keras**.

The MNIST dataset contains **70,000 grayscale images** of handwritten digits (0 to 9), each sized **28Ã—28 pixels**. In this project, we use a **fully connected feedforward neural network** (Multi-Layer Perceptron) to learn and classify digits.

The model is trained on **60,000 images** and evaluated on **10,000 test images**, demonstrating key concepts in:

* **Data preprocessing** (reshaping, normalization)
* **Neural network architecture design**
* **Model training** using backpropagation and gradient descent
* **Evaluation metrics** (accuracy, loss curves)
* **Making predictions** on new handwritten digits

This project is a practical introduction to deep learning for image classification tasks.
